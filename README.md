# GDSC-Portfolio


A simple portfolio site made entirely using HTML & CSS.
Purpose of this project was for the submission of Challenge Round Problem for GDSC Recruitment.
You can clone this repo OR you can directly access the site from the link on the top right section "About".
Be sure to wait for some time after accessing the site, as it takes a bit of time to load all the assets including images, video etc.
WARNING: DO NOT ACCESS THE SITE FROM MOBILE PHONES.


# Working On:
1. A better footer section.
2. Making it responsive.
3. Adding User Authentication Using Django And Sql-lite.
4. Adding a comment section for further improvement.
